Few Shot Prompting Branch: 
## Overview
The few shot prompting branch contains code for generating XML responses using few-shot learning with the GPT-4All language model. This approach uses examples to guide the model in generating accurate responses to new prompts.

## Files
few_shot_prompting.py: The main script that:
Initializes the GPT-4All model.
Sanitizes XML data by removing comments and special characters.
Defines few-shot examples to guide the model.
Generates responses based on the provided few-shot examples.
Saves the generated responses to a new XML file.
Key Features
Sanitization of XML Data:

The code includes a function to clean XML data by removing comments and special characters to ensure the data is well-formed and ready for processing.

The script provides several few-shot examples to guide the GPT-4All model in generating appropriate XML responses based on new prompts.

## Model Initialization:
Uses the mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_0.gguf model from GPT-4All, set to run on a CPU.
## Response Generation:
The model uses the provided few-shot examples to generate a response for a new prompt and save the response to an XML file.

## How to Use
Load the Script:
Open the few_shot_prompting.py file in your Python environment.
Modify Few-Shot Examples:
If needed, modify the few-shot examples to better suit your specific use case.
Run the Script:
Execute the script to generate XML responses based on the provided examples and new prompts.
Save Generated XML:
The script saves the generated XML response to fewshot.xml.
