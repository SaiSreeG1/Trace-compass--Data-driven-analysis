## Overview
The Initial branch contains comprehensive code for describing the structure and important tags of XML files, sanitizing XML data, generating prompts, and processing XML content using the GPT-4All language model. The branch includes functionalities for tokenizing XML data, converting it to YAML format, and back to XML, ensuring the integrity of the data.

## Key Features
XML Structure Description:
Provides an overview of the key elements and tags in the XML files.
Elements include <tmfxml>, <timeGraphView>, <pattern>, and important tags such as <irq>, <name>, and <cpu>.

## Sanitization:
Contains a function sanitize_xml to clean XML data by removing comments and unnecessary spaces.
Ensures that XML data is well-formed and free from extraneous characters.

## Prompt Generation:
Combines XML descriptions and sanitized data to create detailed prompts for the GPT-4All model.
Uses these prompts to guide the model in generating accurate XML content.

## Model Initialization:
Initializes the GPT-4All model (mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_0.gguf) for generating responses.
Ensures the model is ready for processing XML-related prompts.

## Response Generation:
Uses the GPT-4All model to generate XML content based on the given prompts.
Includes a chat session loop to handle multiple prompts and accumulate responses.

## Tokenization and YAML Conversion:
Tokenizes XML data into a sequence of tokens using tokenize_xml.
Creates a simulated attention mask to track token importance.
Converts tokens to YAML format using the model, providing a structured view of the XML data.

## XML to YAML and Back:
Converts XML to YAML and back to XML, ensuring the structure and content remain intact.
Functions yaml_to_tokens and detokenize_xml handle the conversion processes.

## File Handling:
Saves modified XML content to files for further use.
Example files include matt_modified_irq_analysis_lttng.xml and modified_ssh_failed_connections.xml.
