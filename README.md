## Overview
The holbox branch contains code for generating explanations from XML files using HolboxAI's summarizer and regenerating XML files from these explanations using the GPT-4All language model. This process assists in understanding and modifying XML files by leveraging natural language processing.


holbox_script.py: The main script that:
Initializes the GPT-4All model.
Defines a custom LLM class for handling prompts and responses.
Uses HolboxAI's summarizer to generate explanations from XML data.
Regenerates XML files from the generated explanations using the GPT-4All model.
Processes multiple XML files, generating explanations and regenerating XML for each.

Key Features
Model Initialization:
Uses the mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_0 model from GPT-4All for generating responses based on prompts.
Custom LLM Class:
Defines a class to interact with the GPT-4All model, simplifying the generation of responses.
XML Explanation Generation:
Utilizes HolboxAI's summarizer to generate human-readable explanations from XML data.
XML Regeneration:
Regenerates XML files from explanations using the GPT-4All model, enabling modifications and understanding of XML content.
Processing Multiple XML Files:
Handles multiple XML files, generating explanations and regenerated XML content for each, and storing the results.
Example Usage
Example XML:
The script processes a list of XML strings, generating explanations and regenerating XML from these explanations.

How to Use
Load the Script:
Open the holbox.py file in your Python environment.
Add XML Strings:
Add your XML strings to the xml_list variable to process them.
Run the Script:
Execute the script to generate explanations and regenerate XML files based on the provided XML data.
View Results:
