This document outlines the process and results of using Stress-ng in a Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment to test and improve the speed of my laptop. Stress-ng is a powerful benchmarking tool that stresses various system components to identify performance bottlenecks and enhance overall speed.


Objectives:
1. Evaluate System Performance: Measure the performance of the laptop under heavy load conditions.
2. Optimize Processor Usage: Ensure all available processors are utilized to improve speed.


System Configuration:
Operating System: Windows 10 with WSL
CPU: 12-core processor


Commands Used:
1. Basic Stress Test:
  stress-ng
    This command initiates a basic stress test to load various system components.

2. CPU Stress Test:
  stress-ng -c 12
    This command runs a stress test on all 12 CPU cores.


Results:
Initial State: Only 4 out of 12 processors were active, and the CPU speed was less than 1.6 GHz.
Post-Test State: All 12 processors became active, and the CPU speed increased to 3.6 GHz.
By using Stress-ng, I was able to fully utilize my laptop's processing power, resulting in a significant increase in speed. This optimization demonstrates the effectiveness of Stress-ng in identifying and addressing performance issues in a WSL environment.
